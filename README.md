### Objective 
In this project I use the data from IBM Watson Studio platform data to build the recommendation system suggests articles for users to interact.


### Contents 

The recommender system can make recommendations in a number of ways:

**Collaborative Filtering**.  
Takes into account the similarity of users and recommends the most popular articles read by similar users.

**Rank Based Recommendations**. 
Recommends the highest ranked articles starting with the most highly ranked.

**SVD - Matrix Factorization Recommendations**. 
Utilises matrix operations to predict the ranking (or in this case the boolean interaction variable)
